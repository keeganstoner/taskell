## Misc.

- Automate website publishing when doing a new build
    > Should automatically update the `_config.yml` file, build the website, then deploy it
- Add more information to taskell.app
    > Update taskell.app to have more than just README.md contents. Use cases, more images, examples, etc.
    * [ ] Use case example: checklist
    * [ ] Use case example: Git controlled tasks

## Refactoring

- Use a Makefile instead of bash script
- Break up State module
- Parse checkItems Trello JSON using Aeson FromJSON rather than needing extra record type
- Use a map in Actions to tidy things up/add custom key support
- Avoid having to normalise the state?
- Remove duplication of config - currently using ini and hard-coded defaults
- Move Help modal creation into Template Haskell
- Add a List widget for common actions between tasks and sub-tasks
- Tidy up load functions in IO.Taskell
- Remove `~` style sub-task complete parsing
    @ 2018-12-10

## Bugs

- Very long words should get hyphenated
    > The cursor gets lost if a word is longer than the line - URLs in particular can cause issues
- Help modal needs to wrap and scroll
- Modal boxes shouldn't be full height unless they need to be
- Up and down in search gets a bit lost
- Multiple spaces in a line don't show up as more than one, but are saved as more than one
- Task description should be visible by default in task detail
    > Visibility should be on the description by default?
- No obvious way to know if there are more items in a list off-screen
    > Lowest item should be "..." if more items
- Can't remove a description
- Date should update if taskell is left open

## Features

- Check times work no matter what timezone
- Add custom key support
- Show filename somewhere
- Editable title?
    > Use a `# Title` at top of file and display title somewhere in taskell
- Add tags/labels with `t`
- URL field - plus config to run specific command when selected (e.g. `open -a Chrome.app #{url}`)
- Redo functionality
- Make trello token UX better
    * [ ] Open link automatically?
    * [ ] Ask for token and save to ini file automatically
- Reordering sub-tasks
- Add Trello syncing
- Item count for lists?
    > Show the numbers of items in a list next to its title
- Always show list title
    > Floating list titles - so you can always see what list you're in
- Duplicate task with `+`
- Some way to just see tasks with due dates
    * [ ] Sort by date or filter by urgency?
- Ability to load a taskell file with custom config.ini settings
    > Either command line arguments for settings or just a `-c other.ini` command

## In Progress

- Use lenses for nested data
- Add more tests
    * [x] Trello response parsing

- `C` to change task - i.e. deletes text and goes into edit mode
- Space moves to next and stays in list / H & L move but keep current
- Cursor position assumes single line list title
- `E` edits list title
- Pressing enter on Edit creates new task
- Reordering leftmost list left takes you to last list

- Homebrew support
- Tabs in tasks throw off cursor and wrapping
- Cursor vertical offset is wrong when adding a new list
- Search using `/`
- Change foldl to foldl`

- Feels sluggish in sub-task view - cache main view?
- Leaving search only refreshes current list
- Display a warning if any line of the file could not be parsed - otherwise could lead to data loss
- One bad config line stops all config from working - needs to merge with defaultConfig
- Split up Draw/Modal code into more logical chunks
- Move between lists with `m` - shows possible lists
- Caching issue when using `m` to move lists - doesn't update previous list
- Copy and paste?
- Pressing Enter on empty list shows an subtasks box with an error

    > Use â‰¡?

    * [x] Error on parse issues
    * [x] Error on Auth issues
- Add due dates to tasks with `@`
    * [x] Render due dates
    * [x] Editable due dates
