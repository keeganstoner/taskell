In Taskell.Events.State.hs there are a bunch of functions imported from Taskell.Data.List and Taskell.Data.Task, etc. 

Then they are overwritten (I think)

Example: getCurrentTask. 
In State.hs, this is a function State -> Maybe Task
defined as getList state >>= L.getTask

L was imported as Taskell.Data.List, and getTask is defined in there. 
There, getTask is Int -> List -> Maybe T.Task (T is Taskell.Data.Task)
defined as idx = (^? tasks . element idx), whatever that means.
