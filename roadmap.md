## Misc.

- Add Twitter links
    * Website
    * Github
- Automate website publishing when doing a new build
    > Should automatically update the `_config.yml` file, build the website, then deploy it
- Move image to taskell.app
    > The demo image should live on the taskell.app server, rather than being on an orphan branch on GitHub
    * Move image
    * Update site
    * Update GitHub README.md
    * Remove img branch
- Add more information to taskell.app
    > Update taskell.app to have more than just README.md contents. Use cases, more images, examples, etc.
    * Use case example: checklist
    * Use case example: Git controlled tasks

## Refactoring

- Use a Makefile instead of bash script
- Update Task field naming
    * Task: description -> name/title
    * Task: summary -> description
    * ~UI.Modal.SubTasks -> UI.Modal.Detail~
- Break up State module
- Use a map in Actions to tidy things up/add custom key support
- Avoid having to normalise the state?
- Remove duplication of config - currently using ini and hard-coded defaults
- Move Help modal creation into Template Haskell
- Use lenses for nested data?
- Add a List widget for common actions between tasks and sub-tasks
- Tidy up load functions in IO.Taskell
- Remove `~` style sub-task complete parsing

## Bugs

- Very long words should get hyphenated
    > The cursor gets lost if a word is longer than the line - URLs in particular can cause issues
- Help modal needs to wrap and scroll
- No obvious way to know if there are more items in a list off-screen
    > Lowest item should be "..." if more items
- Task description not visible on shorter screens
    > Visibility only applies to scroll items, so description is often hidden if the screen height is small
- Modal boxes shouldn't be full height unless they need to be
- Up and down in search gets a bit lost
- Caching doesn't clear properly when using `o` and `O`
- Multiple spaces in a line don't show up as more than one, but are saved as more than one
- The isBlank check on tasks could potentially delete a task with no description but which does have sub-tasks

## Features

- Check times work no matter what timezone
- Sort out Homebrew forumula
    > Make the necessary changes so that taskell can be put on the homebrew-core repository
    * Find someone to submit it
    * Use `install_cabal_package`
    * Use `depends_on "cabal-install" => :build`
- Add custom key support
- Show filename somewhere
- Editable title?
    > Use a `# Title` at top of file and display title somewhere in taskell
- Add tags/labels with `t`
- URL field - plus config to run specific command when selected (e.g. `open -a Chrome.app #{url}`)
- Redo functionality
- Make trello token UX better
    * Open link automatically?
    * Ask for token and save to ini file automatically
- Reordering sub-tasks
- Add Trello syncing
- Item count for lists?
    > Show the numbers of items in a list next to its title
- Always show list title
    > Floating list titles - so you can always see what list you're in
- Add description status indicator option to config.ini
    > Part of the themeing should allow changing to different icon - might not work in all fonts
- Duplicate task with `+`

- If no lists crashes on up/down - using index in AllTasks
- State should return Maybe?
- Select lists with `1-9`
- Run with any correctly formatted json file
- Wrap lines
- UI modules need refactoring
- Horizontal scrolling stops working if a word longer than the column width is entered
- Cursor no longer in the right place
- Space in edit/add mode doesn't move cursor along - bit disconcerting
- If no items in current list, returns a Nothing, so everything dissappears

- Cursor doesn't show on CreateList mode
- Reordering lists with `>` and `<`
- `o` to add on line below
- `O` to add on line above
- `G` take to bottom of file
- Undo with `u`
- Should only save after adding a new item or finished editing an item - should save when pressing Enter while adding new items
- `C` to change task - i.e. deletes text and goes into edit mode
- Space moves to next and stays in list / H & L move but keep current
- Cursor position assumes single line list title
- `E` edits list title
- Pressing enter on Edit creates new task
- Reordering leftmost list left takes you to last list
- Linux binary
- Homebrew support
- Tabs in tasks throw off cursor and wrapping
- Cursor vertical offset is wrong when adding a new list
- Search using `/`
- Change foldl to foldl`
- Debian package
- Empty tasks aren't obviously selectable
- Pressing `e` on a blank list breaks things
- Add support for Markdown

- Sub-lists
    * ~Scrolling in sub-tasks~
    * ~Press Enter to create next~
    * ~Word wrapping~
    * ~Searching~
    * ~Delete items~
- No cursor in sub-task view
    * ~Single line~
    * ~Multi-line~
- Customisable Markdown format
    * ~Change top level headers~
    * ~Change top level list item: e.g. to H3 instead of li~
    * ~Change sub-list: e.g. from "    *" to "-"~
- Feels sluggish in sub-task view - cache main view?
- Leaving search only refreshes current list
- Display a warning if any line of the file could not be parsed - otherwise could lead to data loss
- One bad config line stops all config from working - needs to merge with defaultConfig
- Split up Draw/Modal code into more logical chunks
- Move between lists with `m` - shows possible lists
- Caching issue when using `m` to move lists - doesn't update previous list
- Copy and paste?
- Pressing Enter on empty list shows an subtasks box with an error
- Cursor goes missing on the left hand side at the end of a line - needs to wrap
- Sub-task count not visible on last item in a list longer than the vertical height
- Vertical spacing doesn't work if the current item is blank
- Empty tasks - i.e. just a space - don't show up
- Editing list title doesn't always have visibility
- Left/Right arrow keys in insert mode
- Share code between tasks and sub-tasks lists?
    * ~Move wrap into Field widget~
    * ~Use Field for search~
    * ~Use Field for sub-tasks~
    * ~Use Field for titles~
    * ~Use Field for tasks~
    * ~Make sure `C` works~
- Copy and paste
    * ~List titles~
    * ~Search~
- Multiple spaces at the beginning of a line can break cursor positioning
- Task body - e.g. as well as sub lists, have a longer description
- Indicator for when a task has a description
    > Use â‰¡?
- Pressing `Esc` when entering task description shouldn't reset it
- Better Trello import errors - e.g. auth vs. parsing issues
    * ~Error on parse issues~
    * ~Error on Auth issues~
- Add due dates to tasks with `@`
    * ~Render due dates~
    * ~Editable due dates~
- Trello dates need to take current timezone into account
    > Trello gives dates in UTC, but need to display them in the current timezone. Deadlines should also take timezones into account if necessary.
- Move to column only works for columns before the one you're in
- Add Trello import
